# Hangman-game
(week three homework- Richmond bootcamp)

This project originated as a homework assignment for the University of Richmond Bootcamp. The object of the assignment is to learn the use of basic programming logic to include working with conditional statements, loops, and arrays while deepening one's understanding of all the previously learned topics to include HTML/CSS, and "vanilla" javascript.

This game is a basic hangman game with a beach theme. It is played by the traditional rules of hangman. The User will press any key to start the game with the blank tiles displayed as well as all letter choices. The User chooses a letter and it will either be displayed in the corresponding tile if it is correct or if incorrect, the hangman picture will get an additional body part. This continues until all letters are guessed correctly or the hangman is hung. To restart another game, the User must reload the page.

This is the first project coded in the class with javascript. It is very basic and meets the objective of the assignment however, I would give the User more options to navigate the game without reloading the whole web page.
